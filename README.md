# Deloitte-virtual-Internship-Forage

## Task 1
Having the data unification algorithm, Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company.
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. 
Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

The second task is to analyse the telemetry data collected by Daikibo (and unified with your algorithm) in a software called Tableau.


## Task 2

An excel file containing 3 columns:

Factory
Job Role
Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score in those 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
